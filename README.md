Neural Network Digit Classifier
A from-scratch implementation of a neural network for handwritten digit recognition (0-9), built using only NumPy and Pandas (To read the csv file).

The network is trained on pixel data and demonstrates concepts including forward propagation, backpropagation, and optimization.

Features:
Neural Network Implementation: Dense layers, ReLU activation, and Softmax output
Adam Optimizer: Implementation of the Adam optimization algorithm
Manual Train-Test Split: Data splitting without external libraries
Comprehensive Evaluation: Detailed performance metrics and per-class analysis
